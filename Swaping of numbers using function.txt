 Swaping of numbers using function

/*Declaring and Defining functions
~For declaring a function the return type ,the function main & formal list is included.
 This is also called as function header followed by a ';'.
~These decleration are placed in global decleration section before the main function.
This is also called function prototype.
~The function decleration is followed by function body which contains local 
decleration & statemets that definestasks to be acompanied by the fuction.
 At last a function is defined with the same parts but no ';' at end.*/

/*In this approch the actual argument are used in a function called that can be a vaiable,constant or an expression.
The values of actual argument are passed through a function.
  When control is transfferd to called functionthe values of actual arguments are substituted through formal arguments
 & the body of function is executed*/
